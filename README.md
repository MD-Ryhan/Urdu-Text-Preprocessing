# Urdu Text Preprocesing Task
Urdu text preprocessing is an important step in natural language processing that involves cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw Urdu text data into a form that can be analyzed by machines. In Python, there are various libraries and tools available for Urdu text preprocessing that can be used to perform tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal, normalization, and more.

Here is a brief overview of some of the common Urdu text preprocessing tasks that can be performed in Python:
- **Tokenization:** Tokenization involves splitting a piece of text into individual words or tokens. This is an important step in text analysis because it provides a basic unit of analysis that can be used to count occurrences of words, perform sentiment analysis, and more. Urdu text can be tokenized using libraries such as Urduhack, spaCy, and NLTK.
	
- **Urdu Stopword removal:** Removing words that occur frequently in a language and are unlikely to carry any useful information for text classification.
	
- **Urdu Text Lemmatization:** Lemmatization can be an important step in Urdu text preprocessing, as it can help to reduce the number of unique words in a corpus and improve the accuracy of natural language processing models.
	
	
- **Hashtag, HTML tag, mention, punctuation, number, and URL removal:** Removing all the hashtags, HTML tags, mentions, punctuations, numbers, and URLs from the text.


- **Part-of-speech tagging::**  Part-of-speech (POS) tagging involves identifying the grammatical parts of speech of each word in a sentence, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. POS tagging can be performed using libraries such as Urduhack,stanza and spaCy.

- **Count POS Tag:** The output of the ud_pos_tag() function is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its corresponding POS tag. We then use the Counter() function from the collections library to count the frequency of each POS tag in the text.

Overall, Urdu text preprocessing in Python involves a combination of these tasks to transform raw text data into a form that can be analyzed by natural language processing models. The choice of preprocessing tasks will depend on the specific NLP task at hand, as well as the quality and complexity of the input text data.
